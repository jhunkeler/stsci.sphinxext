stsci_sphinxext
===============

.. author:: Michael Droettboom, 2009

Purpose
-------

This project contains extensions to Sphinx for internal use at STScI.

Prerequisites
-------------

- Sphinx 0.6.3 or later, and its dependencies

- numpydoc - provides support for Numpy-style docstring syntax

  - The version shipped with Numpy 1.4.0 or later is required

Usage
-----

These instructions only cover changes from the standard Sphinx
instructions.

Create a new tree for your Sphinx documentation, using
sphinx_quickstart, as described in the `Sphinx introduction
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/intro.html#setting-up-the-documentation-sources>`_.

Import the stsci_sphinx customizations into your project's `conf.py`
by inserting the following line at the top::

  from stsci_sphinxext.conf import *

The "extensions" line in your `conf.py` should also be modified so it
doesn't override the extensions defined by stsci_sphinxext.  For
example, change::

  extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']

to::

  extensions += ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']

Also, comment out the 'html_theme' line, so your project will use the
stsci_sphinxext one.
